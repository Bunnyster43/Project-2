# Project-2

## Goal:
  
  * Build something awesome for your portfolio

  * Improve your full-stack and Git skills

## Requirements:

  * Must be a full-stack Node/Express application

  * Must utilize a MySQL database with an ORM (Sequelize or custom-built)

  * Routes must follow RESTful guidelines (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

  * Must use at least one new technology, front-end library, or npm package that we haven't talked about in class

  * Must be deployed to Heroku (or similar)

    * _Do not make light of this step. Deploy and test early!_

  * Codebase must be well-organized using MVC architecture (models, views, controllers)
  
    * _You will get docked points if you have node modules or .DS Store files checked into your repository_

## Optionals:

  * Handlebars (if your website is mostly static content)

  * User login (but only if it makes sense to have accounts)

    * _If you add a user login, look into implementing cookies to keep users signed in. DO NOT USE PASSPORT. You are not ready for it yet._

  * Third-party APIs

    * _Now that you are back-end developers, you aren't restricted by CORS errors or other authentication blocks._

## Presentation Date:

  * Monday, July 9th

    * Plan to wrap up your project by July 3rd, though, so you can enjoy the long holiday weekend.

    * Presentations will be recorded, so you _must_ use the instructor's laptop to demo it.
